# Challenges


## How to win

You will be judged according to the following criteria:

* Novelty (how original is your idea?)
* Execution (how well does your project function and do what it should?)
* Data Analytics (how well have you managed to extract information from raw data?)
* Design (how well does your project address and satisfy real user needs?)
* Business potential (do you have a credible plan for making your project sustainable?)
* Teamwork (how well did you work together and distribute tasks?)

You don’t need to score points in all of these, but the more you do the better you’re project is likely to be. That’s why it is really helpful to have a team of people from mixed backgrounds &mdash; programmers, designers and business people &mdash; all working together. But if you don’t have a mixed team, you can make up a shortfall in one dimension by doing really well in another.

## Judging

Judging will be carried out in two phases. 

### Phase 1: 13:30 - 15:00, Forrest Hill

You will be allocated a table somewhere in the Drill Hall or nearby. Judges will come to visit you and talk about your project. It’s up to you whether you want to talk to more than one judge at a time. This is opportunity for you explain your project in depth. 

At 15:00, make your way over to G07 in Informatics Forum.

### Phase 2: 15:30 - 16:30, Informatics Forum

You will be given 5 mins to pitch your project to the judges (and anyone else who’s interested). You won’t have time to explain your project in depth, but at least some of the judges will have already talked to you. In order to structure your pitch, we recommend that you use the [Value Proposition Canvas](http://www.peterjthomson.com/2013/11/value-proposition-canvas/) model.

After the pitches are over, the judges will confer about prizes, and we aim to have the awards ceremony at 17:30.

<!-- ## Themes

Use of the particular themes will be taken into account by the people judging your project, so you might have more chance of winning a prize if you work on something in one or more of these areas. This year's themes are:

* eCommerce and Customer Experience
* Mobility Data Analytics
* Geographic Business Intelligence
* Data Visualisation
* Community Mapping
* Student Experience -->

### [Amey](//www.amey.co.uk)

####  Transport Data Analytics

In all societies, the transportation system is vital because it connects people, goods, and services. In recent decades, significant increases in urbanization have placed a burden on most cities transport systems around the world. The goal of this challenge is to provide a holistic view of the public transport network of a city like London in order to predict demand and optimise capacity, assets and infrastructure.

**Key Datasets:**

* [TfL API](https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/open-data-users/)
* [Network Rail API](https://datafeeds.networkrail.co.uk/ntrod/login)

### [Aquila Insight](//www.aquilainsight.com)

#### Geographic Business Intelligence

Organisations are constantly looking at how they can efficiently communicate with the users and customers they serve.  Whether it is a bank, retail company or local council, understanding geographical differences can make the difference between success or failure.

Consider supermarket brands such as Waitrose &mdash; they would have a desire to (i) place their store optimally to attract people who might be interested in their brand and what they offer and (ii) avoid spending money on advertising in an area that does not have a Waitrose store.

There are typically a number of elements organisations look at when focusing on a particular geography:

* Regional activity levels for the type of product &mdash; is it a buoyant market or in decline?
* The population density of the area.
* People who are likely to buy a specific product type or use a service, e.g. wealth and need profiles.
* The transport network &mdash; is it convenient for staff and customers to reach the business or service?
* The extent of existing physical outlets in a given area &mdash; existing stores/branches, partners, competitors.
* Marketing expenditure within the area.


**Key Datasets:**

We can provide access to data that has some relevant data such as:

* Postcode lookup file
* Population segmentation data
* Land registry data

We would like you to explore how open data could be incorporated, e.g.

* [data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk)

### [City of Edinburgh Council](//www.edinburgh.gov.uk/)

#### Data as Art

Data is not always easy for people to read or understand, and the Council is interested in exploring new ways of presenting data so that it is immediately understood and indeed stimulates the viewer to relate to the data in a new way &mdash; communicating the work of the Council, but also helping them to see a new use, or to identify with the data in their own lives or work.   The aspiration might be to generate new and innovative thinking, simply by presenting data in a way not previously considered.  This would benefit not only citizens but staff in the Council and our partners.

How can you inspire, inform and educate with our data? 3D modelling and printing, physical and or virtual design, physical products or installations &mdash; all of these outputs would offer the city a new way of understanding and using data. Some of the examples below are not data examples but the product or the materials could be used in the same way.  The key is to represent data in a completely new way.

### Information Services, [Learning Teaching and Web](http://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/about/organisation/learning-teaching-web)

#### How can we make MyEd more relevant and useful?

MyEd can get up to 100,000 logins per day, including up to 20,000 from mobile devices.  However, the information offered on MyEd can often seem confusing and overwhelming. How can we present the information in a way that makes more sense to students?

More specifically, what improvements can be achieved by:

* combining existing data with user attributes, and
* combining location data with other information sources.

<!-- The first mobile-friendly version of MyEd was released in October 2014, more than doubling the number of users accessing MyEd on mobile devices.  IS aims to continually improve the value of MyEd, especially on mobiles, and is starting to open-up data and APIs that are relevant to this challenge.
 -->


#### Virtual Edinburgh Mobile Maker Platform

Build a cross-platform app for [Virtual Edinburgh](http://datablog.is.ed.ac.uk/files/2015/09/Silvertown-Dealing-with-Data-31.8.15-Final.pdf) with [AppGyver mobile maker platform](http://www.appgyver.com/)

### [Médecins sans Frontières](http://www.msf.org) &amp; [Global Development Academy](http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/global-development)


#### Missing Maps

The [Missing Maps Project](http://www.missingmaps.org) aims to map the most vulnerable people in the world, in preparation for or during humanitarian crises. This is a collaboration between the American British Red Cross, Médecins sans Frontières (MSF) and the H[umanitarian OpenStreetMap Team](https://hotosm.org) (HOT). Base maps are created using OpenStreetMap.

The challenges are:

* Visualising Missing Maps data contributions so that remote mappers and local communities can get feedback about their progress in providing missing information.
* Developing a [JOSM plugin](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/wiki/Plugins) that makes it easier to upload to OSM data captured in the field
