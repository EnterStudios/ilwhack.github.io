# Challenges


## How to win

You will be judged along the following dimensions:

* Novelty (how original is your idea?)
* Execution (how well does your project function and do what it should?)
* Design (how well does your project address and satisfy real user needs?)
* Sustainability (do you have a credible plan for making your project sustainable?)
* Teamwork (how well did you work together and distribute tasks?)

You don’t need to score points in all of these, but the more you do the better you’re project is likely to be. That’s why it might be helpful to have a team of people from mixed backgrounds &mdash; programmers, designers and business people &mdash; all working together. But if you don’t have a mixed team, you can make up a shortfall in one dimension by doing really well in another.

## Themes

Use of the particular themes will be taken into account by the people judging your project, so you might have more chance of winning a prize if you work on something in one or more of these areas. This year's themes are:

* Communities and civic engagement
* International development
* Travel and adventure
* Data visualisation
* Student experience

#### Transport Data APIs

In all societies, the transportation system is vital because it connects people, goods, and services. In recent decades, significant increases in urbanization have placed a burden on most cities transport systems around the world. The goal of this challenge is to provide a holistic view of the public transport network of a city like London in order to predict demand and optimise capacity, assets and infrastructure.

### Aquila Insight

####

Organisations are constantly looking at how they can efficiently communicate with the users and customers they serve.  Whether it is a bank, retail company or local council, understanding geographical differences can make the difference between success or failure.

Consider supermarket brands such as Waitrose &mdash; they would have a desire to a) place their store optimally to attract people who might be interested in their brand and what they offer and b) avoid spending money on advertising in an area that does not have a Waitrose store.

There are typically a number of elements organisations look at when focusing on a particular geography:

* Regional activity levels for the type of product &mdash; is it a buoyant market or in decline?
* The population density of the area
* People who are likelihood to buy the specific product type e.g. wealth and need profiles
* The transport network &mdash; is it convenient for staff and customers to reach the business?
* The extent of existing physical outlets in a given area &mdash; existing stores/branches, partners, competitors
* Marketing expenditure within the area

### City of Edinburgh Council

#### Data as Art

Data is not always easy for people to read or understand, and the Council is interested in exploring new ways of presenting data so that it is immediately understood and indeed stimulates the viewer to relate to the data in a new way &mdash; communicating the work of the Council, but also helping them to see a new use, or to identify with the data in their own lives or work.   The aspiration might be to generate new and innovative thinking, simply by presenting data in a way not previously considered.  This would benefit not only citizens but staff in the Council and our partners.

How can you inspire, inform and educate with our data? 3D modelling and printing, physical and or virtual design, physical products or installations &mdash; all of these outputs would offer the city a new way of understanding and using data. Some of the examples below are not data examples but the product or the materials could be used in the same way.  The key is to represent data in a completely new way.
