# Challenges


## How to win

You will be judged along the following dimensions:

* Novelty (how original is your idea?)
* Execution (how well does your project function and do what it should?)
* Design (how well does your project address and satisfy real user needs?)
* Sustainability (do you have a credible plan for making your project sustainable?)
* Teamwork (how well did you work together and distribute tasks?)

You don’t need to score points in all of these, but the more you do the better you’re project is likely to be. That’s why it might be helpful to have a team of people from mixed backgrounds &mdash; programmers, designers and business people &mdash; all working together. But if you don’t have a mixed team, you can make up a shortfall in one dimension by doing really well in another.

## Themes

Use of the particular themes will be taken into account by the people judging your project, so you might have more chance of winning a prize if you work on something in one or more of these areas. This year's themes are:

* Communities and civic engagement
* International development
* Travel and adventure
* Data visualisation
* Student experience

## Special Prizes

### CompSoc Best Data Mashup

This is a challenge to produce the best (or silliest) thing you can by mashing together multiple different sources of data.

### Hopper's Helpful Hacker Prize: Kindle

Is there a person who went out of there way to help you and your team during the Smart Data Hack? Was there a person who showed you something new, or took time to explain how something works? Nominate them for the Hopper's Helpful Hacker prize.

Please drop an email to ilw-hack[AT]inf.ed.ac.uk with the subject line "most helpful hacker" and your nomination in the body.

### City of Edinburgh Council


#### What is the social media impact of the Council?

The Council maintains a large number of social media accounts (Twitter and Facebook). Can we use text analytic techniques (such as sentiment detection) over data from these accounts to build a picture of what are hot topics? Most interesting are likely to be Corporate accounts, Libraries, Transport and Neighbourhoods.

#### A civic dashboard for Edinburgh

A civic data dashboard is a way of aggregating data about an adminstrative area and presenting it in a useful, engaging and informative manner for residents. Can we build one for Edinburgh? And what do citizens really want to see?

**Key Datasets**: 

* <http://data.inf.ed.ac.uk/dataset/city-of-edinburgh-council-social-media-accounts>
* [Edinburgh by Numbers](http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/info/20205/performance_and_statistics/1012/edinburgh_by_numbers)

### UoE Information Services | Learning Teaching and Web

#### How can we make MyEd more useful?

MyEd can get up to 100,000 logins per day, including up to 20,000 from mobile devices.  Can we combine existing datasets with user attributes to provide useful new features in MyEd?  There are particular opportunities around location data, and combining this with other information sources.

The first mobile-friendly version of MyEd was released in October 2014, more than doubling the number of users accessing MyEd on mobile devices.  IS aims to continually improve the value of MyEd, especially on mobiles, and is starting to open-up data and APIs that are relevant to this challenge.

#### How can we make the data collected in the Learn VLE more useful to staff & students?

The Learn virtual learning environment (VLE) collects data on interactions within the application. This data is used by system administrators to answer support queries, and improve the service; and by staff to inform and support their teaching activities within courses. Currently the majority of this data is not visible at all to students, and the presentation of data to staff is quite basic. We believe that some of this data could potentially be more useful to students and staff in a variety of ways.

- Can we this data be used to help students individually understand more about their own learning behaviours and performance relative to their peers?
- Is this data of use to staff to better understand how students are interacting with their courses?
- Can we visualise this information to maximise its benefit and impact?

Other questions that go beyond the scope of the VLE, might be

- How could a school use this information to benefit learning and teaching?
- Could this data be combined with other data sets at the University to analyse student behaviours and help in planning?

Potentially this data can contain sensitive information on individuals performance and behaviour. What concerns do students have around privacy and anonymity of this type of information?

There are currently projects running within IS to look at potential displays of similar information to staff and students

### [Practical Action](http://practicalaction.org) and the [Global Development Academy](http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/global-development)


#### Mapping Pro-poor Technology Innovation in Nairobi

There are many innovations in 'pro-poor' technology in developing countries, covering topics like energy, waste, transport and information communication technology. Can we use data from social media and news media to build a picture of such innovations in and around Nairobi, Kenya? And how can we present this data in an informative and scalable manner?


**Key Datasets**: The team will have to find and identify appropriate APIs/data sets from social media used in Kenya and news media sources. We have [some starting points](https://github.com/ewan-klein/ilwhack/blob/master/nairobi_tech.md).

### Scottish Government Analytical Services

#### Interpreting the Scottish Household Survey

What does the Scottish Household Survey tell us about the people of Scotland? How would you present this information to Scottish Government Ministers to help them make spending decisions or introduce new policies? Alternatively how would you present this information to the general public so that they can see how well the Scottish Government is meeting the National Outcomes in the National Performance Framework? Can we enrich the picture by including other data published by the Scottish Government and others?


The Scottish Household Survey collects a wealth of data about the people of Scotland, but is not disseminated as widely as it should be. The main way of making the data available is via a 212 page  report: <http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/0045/00457570.pdf>

**Key Datasets**:   

* Local Authority Tables Excel data: <http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/16002/LATables-2013>. The data behind the tables can be accessed using dropdown menus in the "LA Raw Data" worksheet, e.g., <http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/16002/LATables-2013/2013-exceldownload>
* The National Performance Framework: <http://www.scotland.gov.uk/About/Performance/purposestratobjs>

### Thomson-Reuters

#### Tracing topics in news stories

The underlying theme is to try and extract value from data and in particular leverage any implicit links to create a navigable graph of interesting connections.

* People & Their Quotes
  * Your challenge is to write a computer program to carry out two tasks: firstly, to extract quotations from documents, and secondly, to attribute each quote to the people who said it. This is valuable because it allows us to keep track of who said what. In the news, sometimes people get quoted incorrectly, and ideas morph and spread at the same time (also known as "memes"). So there are many additional research questions that can be explored, such as: What are the topics discussed? Which people talk about the same topic? Who initiates a topic and who agrees with them? We are looking for all sorts of interesting links among people and topics.
* Evolving Topics
  * Your challenge is to write a computer program to detect the main trending topic in a week, and how they change over time. A topic can be seen as a phrase in the headlines that keeps re-occurring more often than you would expect statistically speaking. The benefit of this experiment is that it shows how topics rise and fall in the media over time. This opens up further research into research question such as: How long do topics trend on average? What kind of people are mentioned in the media as trending topics? And how can trending topics be categorized in groups (e.g. "business", "world affairs")?
* Visualise the Topics
  * Your task is to write a computer program that visualizes the topics and named entities in a corpus of news in original ways. Select interesting ways to visualize ahead of any programming. Use paper & pen drawings to create a vision and then choose the right tool to realize that vision (e.g. D3, Processing) to visualize topics, people, organizations and/or temporal trends in the data. Visualization is valuable because they are powerful tools to start a conversation about what is contained in a data set. This opens up research questions like: How could the visualization be turned into an animated film?
* Finding Links
  * Your task is to write a computer program that tags the name of people mentioned in the news, and find how they are related with each other (e.g. "spouse of", "business partner of"). The resulting information can be output as "triples" (NAME1 RELATION NAME2), which forms the basis of knowledge graphs such as YAGO or Freebase, built with the ultimate goal of building a ”Semantic Web”. This opens up research questions like: Who can the results be visualized and queried?

### [Democracy Club](https://democracyclub.org.uk)

#### Who should you vote for in May?

With the upheaval in politics, and especially in Scotland following the referendum, voters at [the upcoming General Election](http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/elections-and-voting/general/general-election-timetable-2015/) are faced with a bewildering amount of claims and information to wade through. What tools can you provide that will help voters reach a decision about who to vote for? The Democracy club has [collected some great ideas](https://github.com/DemocracyClub/Election/blob/master/IDEAS.mkd), and there's plenty of scope for experimentation.
