# Smart Data Hack


The **Smart Data Hack** is a 5-day event during the University of Edinburgh's [Innovative Learning Week](http://www.innovativelearning.ed.ac.uk/smart-data-hack) that brings students to work together to build cool solutions for real-world problems. It encourages interdisciplinary teams to combine their skills in digital technology, business analysis, ethnography and design.

It is hosted by the [School of Informatics](http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/informatics/) in partnership with [The Business School](http://www.business-school.ed.ac.uk/), [The School of Social and Political Sciences](http://www.sps.ed.ac.uk), [The Global Development Academy](http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/global-development) and [Edinburgh Living Lab](hgttp://edinburghlivinglab.org)

Last year's Smart Data Hack was a runaway success, and this year we are expanding the event by including more challenges from more partners!

## When and where?

It's happening from Mon 15th to Fri 19th February 2016 in the Forrest Hill Drill Hall.
