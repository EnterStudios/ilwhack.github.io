#### CitySentiment

* https://github.com/theopavlakou/ilw2015

Takes Tweets from the area of Edinburgh to create a map of sentiment around the city. The final product is an interactive web app that provides a clean visualisation of the city's mood. Users can browse by date, or view the sentiment of live tweets in real time. CitySentiment uses sophisticated sentiment analysis techniques to ensure that the data on show is a meaningful snapshot of Edinburgh's Twitter users. The project could be extended to other cities, and could offer information such as the average sentiment for a user-defined location.

Themes: Data Visualisation, Communities and civic engagement
