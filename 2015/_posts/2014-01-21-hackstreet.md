WhereNow is a website and application that allows you to find interesting locations to travel to based on social media trends. WhereNow keeps you up to date with what’s happening and where it’s happening and, most importantly, helps you get there fast! Based on the idea of discovery and spontaneous travel, WhereNow is the perfect way to plan your next fun adventure!

WhereNow uses a variety of data sources. We take location data generalised from Twitter where we look for areas around the world with anomalously high concentrations of tweets. Based on positive or negative sentiment from those tweets WhereNow converts this location into a trending “hotspot”. We then find the nearest airport to the event and use Simple Weather to tell you what the skies will look like when you get there, a short location descriptions is provided by Wikipedia, maps by Google, flight prices powered by Skyscanner, and photos via Panoramio.
