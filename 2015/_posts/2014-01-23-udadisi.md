Our goal was to visualize the data in a way that is informative and tells a story about various types of emerging technology trends in Nairobi. Beyond technology, it can also serve as a general platform to investigate other key development trends, such as gender or education, and even broader issues of society as well. We used data from local news media (Daily Nation), local reports (Voice of Kibera), technology blog (iHub) and Guardian website, and others can be easily incorporated.

Themes: Data Visualisation, International development, Communities and civic engagement
