Flowery Monsters is a team consisting of a programmer and a graphic designer — two big fans of sci-fi. Driven by the desire to improve the user experience of travel search platform, we redesign a dynamic website for Skyscanner.
We tend to mimic flight traveling as an interstellar odyssey so as to arouse people’s desire to travel. We presume the prime target group of Skyscanner would be the young generation as its market strategy is “compare cheap flights, hotels & car hire”, thus we gamify the process of tickets booking and make it more attractive to the youth. In the interface, floating planets with various sizes represent different flight prices, which is more intuitive for users.
