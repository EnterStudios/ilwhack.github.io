#### Book.ed

* **[Book.ed website](http://powerful-crag-1654.herokuapp.com/)**
* **[Project repository](https://github.com/pbsinclair42/Book.ed)** 

We're creating a website which will suggest a university study space to users based on location, availabilty, etc.  It will also provide a nice visualisation of study space availability over time.
